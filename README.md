Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets)

Sass is a CSS pre-processor.

It has two syntax:

1. Sass (.sass)
2. SCSS (.scss)

SCSS (Sassy CSS) is the newer version of syntax which came into Sass version 3.
SCSS is a superset of CSS. It contains all the CSS features and also expanded to include the features of Sass as well.
Any valid CSS is valid SCSS.

Sass is the older syntax which has lots of indentation. Many people don't like it because it deviates away from raw CSS so much.
SASS is not much different from SCSS apart from that SCSS has brackets and semi-colons.

some SASS features:

- Variables
- Nesting (of CSS)
- Operators
- Mixins (@mixin)
- Inheritance with @extend
- @import


#### Preprocessing

```
sass input.scss output.css
```
